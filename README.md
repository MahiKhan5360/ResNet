# ResNet in PyTorch

This repository contains an implementation of the **Residual Neural Network (ResNet)** architecture from scratch using PyTorch. ResNet is a powerful deep learning architecture known for its skip connections, which allow very deep networks to be trained effectively.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- âœ… Modular implementation of **ResNet-18**
- âœ… Customizable depth (e.g., ResNet-18, ResNet-34)
- âœ… Clean and readable PyTorch code
- âœ… Easy integration with classification pipelines

---

## ðŸ§  Architecture Overview

ResNet introduces **residual blocks** that add skip connections to allow gradients to flow directly through the network, mitigating the vanishing gradient problem in deep models.

****

Each residual block contains:
- 2 convolutional layers
- Batch normalization
- ReLU activation
- Skip connection

## ðŸ§ª Supported Variants

| Model     | Layers Configuration        |
|-----------|-----------------------------|
| ResNet-18 | [2, 2, 2, 2]                |
| ResNet-34 | [3, 4, 6, 3]                |

More variants (e.g., ResNet-50, ResNet-101) can be implemented using `Bottleneck` blocks.
