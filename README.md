# ResNet in PyTorch

This repository contains an implementation of the **Residual Neural Network (ResNet)** architecture from scratch using PyTorch. ResNet is a powerful deep learning architecture known for its skip connections, which allow very deep networks to be trained effectively.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- âœ… Modular implementation of **ResNet-18**
- âœ… Customizable depth (e.g., ResNet-18, ResNet-34)
- âœ… Clean and readable PyTorch code
- âœ… Easy integration with classification pipelines

---

## ðŸ§  Architecture Overview

ResNet introduces **residual blocks** that add skip connections to allow gradients to flow directly through the network, mitigating the vanishing gradient problem in deep models.
